The company’s new insurance policies will cover injuries arising from the use of its ADAS functions such as autonomous parking and smart lane changing, similar to Tesla’s Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) feature for highways and urban roads, the report said. The amount of benefit an owner receives will depend on factors including the percentage of mileage the system is on for and how long it has been active. EV giants Tesla and BYD are also looking to provide customers with lower-cost EV insurance products.
